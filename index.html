            <p>"Sus" stands for "suspicious" or "suspect."</p>
          <p>A significant portion of Gen Z slang originates from African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Terms like "slay," "bussin'," and "no cap" have roots in AAVE and have been popularized by Gen Z.</p>
            <p>"Brain rot" beat 5 other words to become a top Gen Z slang.</p>
    <p>Many terms are born and spread through internet memes, social media trends (like TikTok dances), and online gaming communities.</p>
    <p>Gen Z uses shortening and abbreviations for efficiency (e.g., "sus," "wyd," "idk").</p>
    <p>Words often express strong emotions or exaggeration (e.g., "dead" means extremely funny).</p>
    <p>Some Gen Z slang is a revival of older slang or phrases, giving them new life and meanings.</p>
    <p>The word "stan" originates from Eminem's 2000 song "Stan."</p>
    <p>"Spill the tea" (gossip) is thought to originate from Black drag culture.</p>
    <p>"OK Boomer" dismisses viewpoints associated with older generations.</p>
    <p>Gen Z slang evolves rapidly, becoming outdated quickly ("cheugy").</p>
    <p>Slang can vary regionally within Gen Z.</p>
    <p>"Yeet" means to throw something with great force.</p>
    <p>Gen Z often uses slang ironically or sarcastically.</p>
    <p>Using certain slang can be a way for Gen Z to identify with their peers.</p>
    <p>"Vibe check" assesses mood or atmosphere.</p>
    <p>"Main character energy" describes acting as a protagonist.</p>
    <p>The meaning of Gen Z slang is heavily context-dependent.</p>
